## Established rule for good usability

The heuristics are actually more of a rule of thumb for experts to detect as many usability errors in a system as possible. It therefore only makes sense that designers and information architects follow this rule during the design process of such a system. If the heuristics are **followed from the beginning, many accessibility problems can be avoided**.

---

## Visibility of system status

Nothing is more annoying than a process that the user cannot understand. The system should always give the user **feedback in a reasonable amount of time** and inform him about what is happening. By providing clear feedback on the status of the system, people with disabilities will feel more secure while using the system.

---

## Match between system and the real world

The system should speak to the user in natural language. That means **technical terms and codes should be avoided**. So the user knows what is behind the messages and actions. This can greatly improve a site's accessibility.

---

## User control and freedom

Incorrect functions of a system are quickly selected, we should always and at any time **give the user the opportunity to abort a process** as easy as possible. This can especially help people with disabilities if they accidentally activate a wrong function in the system.

---

## Consistency and standards

A very important point to improve the accessibility of a site. **Same appearance and same wording should always mean the same function**.  

---

## Error prevention

Through the **appearance of the elements and their positioning, errors can be avoided** right from the start. This can reduce the error rate when using the system and at the same time increase accessibility.

---

## Recognition rather than recall

The user should **never have to remember relevant information across multiple interactions**. Objects, options and actions should always be visible. The system should support the user in this, so the accessibility of a page can be increased.

---

## Flexibility and efficiency of use

The system should be customizable for experienced users. So they can use tools and shortcuts to work with the system faster and easier. For inexperienced users or people with disabilities, **the lack of use of such tools should not affect the process**.

---

## Aesthetic and minimalist design
Dialogues should be reduced to the essential. **The usershould only be shown what is relevant for him**. This increases the usability of a page by a screen reader significantly.

---

## Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Error messages should be described as **simply as possible** and should not contain any code. Suggested solutions help the users to solve the problem.

---

## Help and documentation
Even if a system should be self-explanatory, it is helpful to have a **simple and quick guide**.
