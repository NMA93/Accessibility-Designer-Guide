{: .fs-9 }
{: .no_toc }

Accessibility has become increasingly important in recent years. Due to the increasing digitalization in all areas, more and more people are using digital solutions. Nevertheless, the approach “Internet for all” is still not lived enough.

## It affects us all

For me as a UX designer, accessibility is an extremely important topic. On the one side the developers and the code can improve a product enormously in terms of accessibility. On the other side is the design part, which also has a big impacts on accessibility. **As designers we have the power to help create the internet for everyone**. 

According to the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/disabilities "WHO – 10 Facts on disability"){:target="_blank"}, **over 1 billion people worldwide suffer from some form of disability**. Not all of them can use digital solutions, but for those who can, we should make it as easy to use as it is for us.

## There are people with disabilities in every target group

Often the question also arises, **do people with disabilities even belong to our target group?** This question can be answered with yes. People with disabilities make up a [large percentage](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/disabilities "WHO – 10 Facts on disability"){:target="_blank"} of the population. Excluding these people from your services is questionable, not only from a business point of view. It is also a questionable decision from a human perspective and does not contribute to a good company image.

## The user experience is improved for all users

If a website or app is designed and developed with the mindset "Accessible for all", the experience is improved not only for people with disabilities. UX and Accessibility Design do not know any strict boundaries, **a well thought-out UI design and barrier-free programming improves usability** across all target groups.

## Accessible design does not have to be boring

A prejudice that can be heard again and again is that accessible design is boring and restricts creativity. I am always surprised about this attitude, is UX-Design really just "fancy digital product design"? For me it is rather the identification of problems and solving them. This does not mean that the solution cannot be aesthetically pleasing. But there is more to a well-balanced digital product than just making it beautiful. **There is a strategy behind it for the architecture, for the content, for the code and a for the design**. Besides, the principles of accessible design should be kept in mind by many more designers, so some questionable decisions would not be made in the first place.
