## What is ARIA

Even though this topic is more on the technical side, I would still like to discuss it in this chapter. By using ARIA, the accessibility of a website is noticeably improved. For example, **the content of a website can be extended by ARIA to include form descriptions or displays of the current value in progress indicators**. This is extremely helpful for users who want to use a screen reader to navigate a website. But how does it work exactly?

TBD.
