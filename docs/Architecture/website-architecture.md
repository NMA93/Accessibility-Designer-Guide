# Website architecture
{: .no_toc }
{: .fs-9 }

Simple, short and logical ways within the site increase the usability not only for people with disabilities but for all users. But what do you have to consider when creating a website architecture?

Consistency and standards

## Do not use too many link sections

People with visual impairments navigate through a website with a screen reader, and if teasers and links are repeatedly inserted into relevant content, this can severely impair the user experience. Since users with screen readers cannot simply ignore irrelevant content or ignore it later. It is better to include such sections at the end of a page, so that users with screen readers can also ignore them.

## Multiple ways

A content-relevant page should be accessible via several ways within a page architecture. For example, a page can be accessible via a teaser in addition to the navigation. Ideally, there should be several content hubs within a page architecture which only serve to guide the user to his destination. These can be seen as an extension of the navigation and therefore do not disturb users with screen readers. This can help people with cognitive and visual impairments to find content faster.

### Good to know
{: .no_toc }
Pages that only serve to redirect the user to other pages should not contain relevant content. Since they do not have to be visited to navigate the site. Additionally, link-heavy sections in a content-relevant page disturb the user experience with screen readers.
