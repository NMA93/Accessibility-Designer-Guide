The navigation is the heart of many websites and apps. If mistakes are made there, the user experience is significantly affected. But this does not have to be the case.

## Show me the easiest way!

Navigations are basically only intended to help the user find his way around the site. Therefore, as a designer, you should not reinvent the pattern when it comes to navigation. Given standards help to create a solid navigation and if the designer is aware of the rules, visually appealing results can be achieved within this framework.

## Show me the site architecture

Not only the site architecture should follow a linear flow, also the navigation should do so. Optimally, the navigation reflects the page architecture in a simplified form. This helps the user to get an overview of the content.

### Where do I want to go
Highlight navigation points that are in the focus of the user. This helps users who navigate through the page with tab to find their way around.In addition, a hover effect can make navigation easier for all users. Often designers forget that the **focus can also be designed**. For a better orientation of the user, the hover and focus status differs in visuality from the active menu items. See <a href="/Accessibility-Designer-Guide/02-Architecture/04-keyboard%20friendly/"> Keyboard friendly.</a>

### Where am I
Show the user in the navigation where he is on the page. By marking the active menu items, the orientation on the page is noticeably improved for users.

### Where do I come from
But not only the active page should be highlighted, also higher-level pages in the navigation should be highlighted. In this way, the user is always aware of where he or she has come from and where he or she is currently located.

## Breadcrumbs
In addition to navigation, **breadcrumbs are excellent for showing the way of a user**. Many designers tend to remove breadcrumbs for aesthetic reasons. I have a clear opinion on this and think this is a mistake. For complex websites with several navigation levels, they can make navigation a lot easier.


---

## Consistency
UI components with the **same function should always have the same appearance**. Therefore, the navigation within the entire page should have the same visual appearance and language. It can happen that a page has visually different sections, but the navigation should not be affected by this.
