# Support through the system

People with disabilities tend to trigger wrong actions more often than users without disabilities. Therefore it is helpful to plan the system in such a way that mistakes can be avoided already in their beginning.

## Error avoidance through restrictions
One possible way to avoid errors is to limit the user's options. By limiting the input possibilities, the error rate of a system is reduced. For users with limitations, it is more clear what is required of them.

![](//placehold.it/800x400)
In this example with a date, the format of the input is already predefined, plus only the input of numbers is allowed.

## Error avoidance through support
Not only when users are disabled, it can happen that errors are created while information is being entered. This should not be a problem for the user, as a good example of this, searches should be considered. Often suggestions are made while typing. These suggestions also correct typing errors. This avoids empty search results.

![](//placehold.it/800x400)
The automatic search completion reduces the chance of errors during input.

## Error avoidance through repetition
By repeatedly requesting information, the user is forced to verify the information entered. In addition, the system can detect errors by comparing the information and alert the user.

![](//placehold.it/800x400)
A good example of this is repeating e-mail and password. This helps to avoid errors when creating accounts.

## Not all options are always available
Certain actions are dependent on other factors. For example, as a private user I need other input fields like an organization. Therefore it makes sense not to display them for both users. It is better to separate both input variants. For example with a radio button. This way the user is not overwhelmed with too much information.

![](//placehold.it/800x400)
Another example are inactive elements that only become active once everything has been recorded. This way the user knows that he can now proceed to the next step.
