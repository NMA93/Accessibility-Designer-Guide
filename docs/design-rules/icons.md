# Icons

When it comes to icons, different specifications must be observed. Not all icons are self-explanatory or designed for small applications.

## Signs and communication
So that we can take a closer look at the topic of icons and analyze them for accessibility. First we have to understand what an icon is. This definition is actually not as simple as it seems. Charles S. Peirce, a philosopher of the late 19th century defined **[3 basic signs](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce-semiotics/ "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – Peirce’s Theory of Signs"){:target="_blank"} in semiotics: the icon, the index and the symbol.**

### Understanding icon
An icon resembles the object it stands for and thus establishes a connection to it. The following example illustrates this.

![](//placehold.it/800x200)
A classic icon from the field of user interface design is the mail icon. It shows a letter and creates the link to the physical letter and the sending of a message.
{: .fs-2 .fw-800 .mb-6 }

---

### Understanding index
An index indicates what it stands for, the classic example is smoke which stands for fire.

### Understandning symbol
The symbol makes no clear connection to its origin. The meaning often has to be learned culturally, which means that prior knowledge is needed to understand symbols. A good example of this are religious symbols, which are not self-explanatory for all people at first go.

### Understanding icons in UI
Now that we have defined the basics, it is time to transfer them into the user interface design. Here you will notice very quickly that **the icons we use in the user interface design are actually symbols**. The following examples show why this is so. In the beginning of the user interface design we tried to design these icons as close as possible to the original.
{: .mb-6 }

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/system_7.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="In this picture we see the famous System 7 from Apple. Folders look like folders and the trash can looks like a trash can." title="In this picture we see the famous System 7 from Apple. Folders look like folders and the trash can looks like a trash can."/>
In this picture we see the famous System 7 from Apple. Folders look like folders and the trash can looks like a trash can.
[Wikimedia – Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Macintosh_System_7.5.3_screenshot.png "Wikimedia – Apple"){:target="_blank"}
{: .fs-2 .fw-800 .mb-6 }

This design language was taken to extremes with skeumorphism. Where the entire interface is based on reality.
{: .mb-6 }

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/icons/ibook.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="In this picture we see ibook shelf from apple. The visuality of a bookshelf was taken over into the digital." title="In this picture we see ibook shelf from apple. The visuality of a bookshelf was taken over into the digital."/>
In this picture we see ibook shelf from apple. The visuality of a bookshelf was taken over into the digital. Apple.
{: .fs-2 .fw-800 .mb-6 }

And now we also see that at some point we reach a limit with icons as defined by semiotics. Skeumorphism is a nice try, but it is limited. We cannot display complex processes like a "login" or "file sharing" exactly as it is meant. That's why in the UI we rather speak of **symbols which are used as icons**.
