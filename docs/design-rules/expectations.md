# Expectations
{: .no_toc }
{: .fs-9 }

Depending on how an element is designed and implemented, it can raise expectations of the user. Especially for users with screen readers, it is important that a standard design pattern behaves as it is defined
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Consistency and standards
{: .label .label-black }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

## What is the problem when patterns change their usual behaviour?
Anyone who has ever pulled a door that actually needs to be pulled knows what it feels like when something behaves differently than expected. This feeling comes up again and again with users who use screen readers or people with disabilities on websites whenever a known pattern behaves differently than the norm requires.

#### The following examples illustrate the problem of wrong expectations:

## Learned behaviour of elements
Certain design patterns have established themselves over the years and should not be reinvented. Users know how to interact with them, and when properly implemented, they are accessible to screen readers and keyboard operations. 

A good collection of design patterns and their behaviour can be found in the [material design documentation](https://material.io/components "material design documentation"){:target="_blank"} of google.
