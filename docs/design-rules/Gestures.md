## Understanding gestures
A gesture control is everything that goes beyond the normal clicking. Therefore, this term must not only be reduced to mobile and touch, but gesture control can also occur on the desktop.

### Desktop

The following gesture controls can occur on the desktop:

- drag to interact
- scroll to interact
- hold to interact

## Making alternatives visible
Gestures are basically no problem, they help power users to find their way around the system more quickly. However, a click variant should always be offered. This also helps people with disabilities to use the system.
