# Accessibility Designer Guide
In this guide I try to answer as many questions as possible about Accessibility Design based on existing guidelines [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines "W3C Website"){:target="_blank"} and my personal experience. Before you jump into the topic you should know that this guide is limited to design only and does not cover the topic of code. It does partly relate to code, but only superficially.
