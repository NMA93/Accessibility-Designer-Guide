<p class="fs-6 fw-300">People with disabilities tend to trigger wrong actions more often than users without disabilities. Therefore it is helpful to plan the system in such a way that mistakes can be avoided already in their beginning.</p>

<p>One possible way to avoid errors is to limit the userâ€™s options. By limiting the input possibilities, the error rate of a system is reduced. For users with limitations, it is more clear what is required of them.</p>

<p class="fs-2 fw-800 mb-6"><img src="//placehold.it/800x400" alt="" />
In this example with a date, the format of the input is already predefined, plus only the input of numbers is allowed.</p>

<p>Not only when users are disabled, it can happen that errors are created while information is being entered. This should not be a problem for the user, as a good example of this, searches should be considered. Often suggestions are made while typing. These suggestions also correct typing errors. This avoids empty search results.</p>

<p class="fs-2 fw-800 mb-6"><img src="//placehold.it/800x400" alt="" />
The automatic search completion reduces the chance of errors during input.</p>

<h2 id="error-avoidance-through-repetition">Error avoidance through repetition</h2>
<p>By repeatedly requesting information, the user is forced to verify the information entered. In addition, the system can detect errors by comparing the information and alert the user.</p>

<p class="fs-2 fw-800 mb-6"><img src="//placehold.it/800x400" alt="" />
A good example of this is repeating e-mail and password. This helps to avoid errors when creating accounts.</p>

<p>Certain actions are dependent on other factors. For example, as a private user I need other input fields like an organization. Therefore it makes sense not to display them for both users. It is better to separate both input variants. For example with a radio button. This way the user is not overwhelmed with too much information.</p>

<p class="fs-2 fw-800 mb-6"><img src="//placehold.it/800x400" alt="" />
Another example are inactive elements that only become active once everything has been recorded. This way the user knows that he can now proceed to the next step.</p>
