<h2 id="established-rule-for-good-usability">Established rule for good usability</h2>

<p>The heuristics are actually more of a rule of thumb for experts to detect as many usability errors in a system as possible. It therefore only makes sense that designers and information architects follow this rule during the design process of such a system. If the heuristics are <strong>followed from the beginning, many accessibility problems can be avoided</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="visibility-of-system-status">Visibility of system status</h2>

<p>Nothing is more annoying than a process that the user cannot understand. The system should always give the user <strong>feedback in a reasonable amount of time</strong> and inform him about what is happening. By providing clear feedback on the status of the system, people with disabilities will feel more secure while using the system.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="match-between-system-and-the-real-world">Match between system and the real world</h2>

<p>The system should speak to the user in natural language. That means <strong>technical terms and codes should be avoided</strong>. So the user knows what is behind the messages and actions. This can greatly improve a site’s accessibility.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="user-control-and-freedom">User control and freedom</h2>

<p>Incorrect functions of a system are quickly selected, we should always and at any time <strong>give the user the opportunity to abort a process</strong> as easy as possible. This can especially help people with disabilities if they accidentally activate a wrong function in the system.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="consistency-and-standards">Consistency and standards</h2>

<p>A very important point to improve the accessibility of a site. <strong>Same appearance and same wording should always mean the same function</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="error-prevention">Error prevention</h2>

<p>Through the <strong>appearance of the elements and their positioning, errors can be avoided</strong> right from the start. This can reduce the error rate when using the system and at the same time increase accessibility.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="recognition-rather-than-recall">Recognition rather than recall</h2>

<p>The user should <strong>never have to remember relevant information across multiple interactions</strong>. Objects, options and actions should always be visible. The system should support the user in this, so the accessibility of a page can be increased.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="flexibility-and-efficiency-of-use">Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>

<p>The system should be customizable for experienced users. So they can use tools and shortcuts to work with the system faster and easier. For inexperienced users or people with disabilities, <strong>the lack of use of such tools should not affect the process</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="aesthetic-and-minimalist-design">Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
<p>Dialogues should be reduced to the essential. <strong>The usershould only be shown what is relevant for him</strong>. This increases the usability of a page by a screen reader significantly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="help-users-recognize-diagnose-and-recover-from-errors">Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
<p>Error messages should be described as <strong>simply as possible</strong> and should not contain any code. Suggested solutions help the users to solve the problem.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="help-and-documentation">Help and documentation</h2>
<p>Even if a system should be self-explanatory, it is helpful to have a <strong>simple and quick guide</strong>.</p>
