<p class="fs-6 fw-300">If the user is in a process on the site, he puts himself in our hands. He trusts that the steps he follows will lead him to the goal. Therefore it is very important for us as designers to make this process as pleasant as possible for all user groups.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-problem-with-processes">What is the problem with processes</h2>
<p>If the user enters a process on a website or in an app, he trusts the system. However, there should never be a feeling that control has been relinquished or that errors may have consequences. A process can pose problems for certain user groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inexperienced or older users feel unsafe</li>
  <li>People with screen readers find it hard to find their way around if processes are not implemented correctly.</li>
  <li>People with physical impairments feel insecure if they accidentally click something wrong in a process.</li>
</ul>
