<h2 id="who-needs-accessible-language">Who needs accessible language?</h2>
<p>As soon as people are confronted with a topic that is more complex than the environment they normally find themselves in, accessible language is useful.</p>

<h4 class="no_toc" id="for-example">For example:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Users who have to take care of their insurance needs.</li>
  <li>When people use online banking.</li>
  <li>When people have to follow technical instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-accessible-language">What is accessible language?</h2>

<p>Not all people find it easy to read and understand words and sentences. Therefore it is important that we enable all users to understand the content of a page. Generally we can define two categories of accessible language.</p>

<h3 id="understandable-content">Understandable Content</h3>
<p>To make content accessible to a wider range of users, including people with disabilities, it is simply a matter of avoiding technical terms. Technical terms require prior knowledge in most cases. This should never be assumed.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-read">Easy-to-read</h3>
<p>If a complex text has to be made available to a wide audience, avoiding technical terms may not always be enough. For example, medical information that is not intended for a specialist audience is already simplified. However, for such complex topics, it is recommended to offer an easy to read version.</p>
