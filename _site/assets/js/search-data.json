    "content": "10 Heuristics of Jakob Nielsen . If there is such a thing as a generally accepted guide to good usability, then these are the 10 interaction design principles of Jakob Nielsen. . . . Established rule for good usability | Visibility of system status | Match between system and the real world | User control and freedom | Consistency and standards | Error prevention | Recognition rather than recall | Flexibility and efficiency of use | Aesthetic and minimalist design | Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors | Help and documentation | . Established rule for good usability . The heuristics are actually more of a rule of thumb for experts to detect as many usability errors in a system as possible. It therefore only makes sense that designers and information architects follow this rule during the design process of such a system. If the heuristics are followed from the beginning, many accessibility problems can be avoided. . . Visibility of system status . Nothing is more annoying than a process that the user cannot understand. The system should always give the user feedback in a reasonable amount of time and inform him about what is happening. By providing clear feedback on the status of the system, people with disabilities will feel more secure while using the system. . . Match between system and the real world . The system should speak to the user in natural language. That means technical terms and codes should be avoided. So the user knows what is behind the messages and actions. This can greatly improve a site’s accessibility. . . User control and freedom . Incorrect functions of a system are quickly selected, we should always and at any time give the user the opportunity to abort a process as easy as possible. This can especially help people with disabilities if they accidentally activate a wrong function in the system. . . Consistency and standards . A very important point to improve the accessibility of a site. Same appearance and same wording should always mean the same function. . . Error prevention . Through the appearance of the elements and their positioning, errors can be avoided right from the start. This can reduce the error rate when using the system and at the same time increase accessibility. . . Recognition rather than recall . The user should never have to remember relevant information across multiple interactions. Objects, options and actions should always be visible. The system should support the user in this, so the accessibility of a page can be increased. . . Flexibility and efficiency of use . The system should be customizable for experienced users. So they can use tools and shortcuts to work with the system faster and easier. For inexperienced users or people with disabilities, the lack of use of such tools should not affect the process. . . Aesthetic and minimalist design . Dialogues should be reduced to the essential. The usershould only be shown what is relevant for him. This increases the usability of a page by a screen reader significantly. . . Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors . Error messages should be described as simply as possible and should not contain any code. Suggested solutions help the users to solve the problem. . . Help and documentation . Even if a system should be self-explanatory, it is helpful to have a simple and quick guide. . . Links . Nielsen Norman Group – 10 Heuristics .",

According to the W3C guidelines, the contrast of text of normal size (approx. 13px - 17px) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

Why it is important | Focus indicators | Structure of the Page | Skip buttons and hidden keyboard features | . Why it is important . Users with disabilities often use the keyboard to navigate on a page. In general, a website should be operable with the keyboard without any restrictions. In most cases it is the task of developers or designers with code knowledge to ensure this. However, even in the design phase, some considerations can be made without code to improve keyboard accessibility and help the developers to optimize the content for keyboard use. . Focus indicators . The focus indicator of a website is a useful tool to improve the usability of the website by using the keyboard. But let’s be honest, the default focus indicators in the browser are not that great. One of the most common problems, they don’t fit into the design. Instead of removing the indicators now, they should be actively designed and planned from the beginning. Because there are possibilities to design them, which unfortunately are often forgotten by designers. . Default focus indicator in Chrome. . When it comes to designing focus indicators, the following should be considered: . The size and shape of the indicator should stand out from the current element. | The indicator should have enough contrast. | The colour of the indicator should fit into the design, but stand out clearly enough. | Make sure that the indicator looks the same on all browsers. | Be sure that the indicator can be applied to all elements. | . Here are some examples of nicely implemented custom focus indicators: . On the myswitzerland website, the focus is elegantly integrated into the design. An outline and a drop shadow serve as indicators here. This creates the impression that the focus surrounds an invisible button. . On the sbb website, the focus was less elegantly integrated, but great attention was given to usability and contrast. . . Structure of the Page . As we have discussed in the chapter on Titles and semantic, the semantic of a website, means structuring the elements on a site into clear groups based on their meaning. This can greatly improve the ease of use of the keyboard. . Structuring the Website into clear sections. . This allows the focus indicator to jump from element to element more quickly and easily. As a designer, it makes sense to design in individual elements from the very beginning, so that clear groups of elements are later developed on the page. . . Skip buttons and hidden keyboard features . A very important feature when operating websites through the keyboard are hidden keyboard features. These are navigation points which can only be reached by using the keyboard, for example we can have a closer look at the google search. After a search, we can enter the separate keyboard menu by using the tab key. This way keyboard users can skip links in the header and immediately go to the main content, this is a so-called skip button. This means that we have to plan additional space in the navigation to fit a keyboard navigation. . . Links . W3C – Guideline 2.1 – Keyboard Accessible .",

    "title": "Navigation",
    "content": "Navigation . The navigation is the heart of many websites and apps. If mistakes are made there, the user experience is significantly affected. But this does not have to be the case. . . . Show me the easiest way! | Show me the site architecture Where do I want to go | Where am I | Where do I come from | | Breadcrumbs | Consistency | . Show me the easiest way! . Navigations are basically only intended to help the user find his way around the site. Therefore, as a designer, you should not reinvent the pattern when it comes to navigation. Given standards help to create a solid navigation and if the designer is aware of the rules, visually appealing results can be achieved within this framework. . . Show me the site architecture . Not only the site architecture should follow a linear flow, also the navigation should do so. Optimally, the navigation reflects the page architecture in a simplified form. This helps the user to get an overview of the content. . Where do I want to go . Highlight navigation points that are in the focus of the user. This helps users who navigate through the page with tab to find their way around.In addition, a hover effect can make navigation easier for all users. Often designers forget that the focus can also be designed. For a better orientation of the user, the hover and focus status differs in visuality from the active menu items. See Keyboard friendly. . Where am I . Show the user in the navigation where he is on the page. By marking the active menu items, the orientation on the page is noticeably improved for users. . Where do I come from . But not only the active page should be highlighted, also higher-level pages in the navigation should be highlighted. In this way, the user is always aware of where he or she has come from and where he or she is currently located. . . Breadcrumbs . In addition to navigation, breadcrumbs are excellent for showing the way of a user. Many designers tend to remove breadcrumbs for aesthetic reasons. I have a clear opinion on this and think this is a mistake. For complex websites with several navigation levels, they can make navigation a lot easier. . . Consistency . UI components with the same function should always have the same appearance. Therefore, the navigation within the entire page should have the same visual appearance and language. It can happen that a page has visually different sections, but the navigation should not be affected by this. . . Links . Nielsen Norman Group – 10 Heuristics .",

Semantic in text | Semantic in Code | | Semantic in Code (HTML5)– Cheatsheet | Why semantics in design helps developers Structure of the page | Correct use of the elements | | . What is meant by semantics? . Semantics is called the theory of the meaning of signs. As designers, we can give meaning to text and other elements through their appearance or positioning. In general, the appearance should support the content and not force a meaning. The following examples illustrate this. . Semantic in text . Everyone of us comes into contact with semantics in text. In typography, text has always been structured by semantic design and optimized for the reader. As an example we can look at a text without any markup. We see in this case a simple block, without any differentiation in itself. . . Just by adding spaces and breaks we can give meaning to the content. Now we see the title and basic font within the text block. . . By adding different sizes and markings in the weight of the font, we can enhance this effect. Now the text is semantically structured. The appearance of the title also gives it the meaning of a title. The same applies to the basic text, which is recognized as basic text by its appearance. . . Semantic in Code . In the code, the semantics are not as clearly visible to the user as we know it from print and typography. Although text on the web is also semantically prepared, there are many more elements that need to be marked up, text alone is not enough. In code, semantics includes all elements on a website. It is important to correctly label the elements. This has the following reasons: . Semantic code can be better read by programs. | Loading times are shortened. | Automatic tables of contents can be created. | The keyboard operation is easier. See Keyboard friendly. | Accessibility is made possible because screen readers can read the content. | . Basically, each element on the page is given a meaning in the code that corresponds to the content or function of the element. This has several advantages, especially in terms of accessibility. The semantics in the code allows screen readers to read the meaning of individual elements, allowing people with impaired vision to navigate the page. . . Semantic in Code (HTML5)– Cheatsheet . HTML 5 Meaning . &lt;h1 – h6&gt; | Titles in text. | . &lt;header&gt; | Header section oft the page. | . &lt;nav&gt; | With this you can mark a section of a page, which contains links for navigation. | . &lt;footer&gt; | Footer section oft the page. | . &lt;article&gt; | Self-contained composition in one document. | . &lt;aside&gt; | Content that indirectly belongs to the rest of the content, for example a dictionary of terms. | . &lt;details&gt; | Is used to mark up additional information, for example in a dropwdown, is often used in combination with the &lt;summary&gt; element. | . &lt;summary&gt; | Is often used to mark additional information, for example in combination with the &lt;details&gt; element. | . &lt;figure&gt; | An element that often explains itself graphically. For example a picture. The corresponding descriptive element is the &lt;figcaption&gt; element. | . &lt;figcaption&gt; | Describes the content of the related &lt;figure&gt; element. | . &lt;main&gt; | This can be used to mark the primary content of a page. for a blog post this would be the main text. | . &lt;mark&gt; | This can be used to identify highlighted text. | . &lt;time&gt; | This can be used to mark times or specific dates in the text. | . . Why semantics in design helps developers . If you are a designer without any code knowledge and now think that this is the job of the developers, you are right, but also not. Correct is, it is the task of the developers to implement the code semantically correct. However, if semantic code principles are followed in the design, the implementation is much easier later in the code. The following principles should be followed: . Structure of the page . Make sure that your design can be categorized into the common areas. Clear areas on your site simplify the structure for developers. . . Correct use of the elements . Use elements correctly and do not complicate your design unnecessarily. An example is overloaded overlays or multi-level nesting in dropdowns. .",

Print also works digitally | Fonts sizes For print | For web | | Line height | Text width Width values | | Colors | Levels of the titles | Do not use text as image | . Print also works digitally . For centuries, typefaces have been refined by type designers, typographers and designers. Many specifications that work for print can also be transferred to the web and can increase the usability of a page. . Fonts sizes . From classical typography we know a clear classification of font sizes, 3 categories have been established: . For print . The consultation size: 6 - 8 point (annotations, margin notes, captions, lexicon entries) | The reading size: 9 - 12 point (larger texts) | The sight size: 14 - 28 point (titles) | . This rule of thumb has proven itself and helps to structure texts in print in a way that is pleasing to the eye. Of course, this rule can also be broken, but to break a rule, one must first know it. . Personally, I always have this rule in mind when I have to develop font sizes for digital products. They are well suited to create a harmonious typeface on the web, but point values cannot simply be adopted 1:1 for pixel values. The following rule serves as a good basis for a typographic system: . For web . The consultation size: 13 – 14px | The reading size: 16 - 20px | The sight size: ca. 24px – to the top without limit | . In general, fonts on the Web should not be smaller than 13px, but if this should happen, it is mostly decorative elements that do not serve the UI or there must be a really good reason to fall below this value. . . Line height . A carefully chosen line height not only helps users with disabilities to understand text faster. The line height varies from font to font and is dependent on the line length and the visual appearance of the font. Still, there are certain basic rules that can help to define a line height that is comfortable for the eye. . As a rule of thumb, the line height should be 120% of the font size, which means at least 12px line height for a 10px font. | The line height should always be clearly larger than the word spacing. | . . Text width . The web is often very generously designed and the complete viewport width is often used. However, a certain part of a website should have clear limitations, and this includes copy text. If the width is too large and the number of characters per line is too high, the eye loses its orientation. This makes it difficult to read texts, not only for people with disabilities. The following example shows this clearly: . . In print, a rule of thumb is 60 – 80 characters per line. I personally like to have a value of 500 – 700 pixels for copy text in the width on a website. This comes pretty close to the rule for print Depending on font and font size. In the end it is a combination of all values that results in a harmonious and pleasantly readable typeface. . . Width values . Desktop: 500 – 700px | Tablet: 500 – 700px | Mobile: full width | . Colors . According to the W3C guidelines, the contrast of text of normal size (approx. 13px - 17px) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. From 18px and larger font sizes, the text must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1. . There are countless tools for checking the contrast of elements and text, one of my favourite tools is the Colour Contrast Analyser from the paciello group. . Check Colours to learn more about colours and contrast. . Levels of the titles . TBD . Do not use text as image . Everyone should be aware of it, and yet it keeps popping up. Text that was placed in a header image in Photoshop and is now available as an image (jpeg or png) on the website. A mortal sin in terms of accessibility. Screen readers have no chance of reading this text unless it is added with alt text. However, I recommend not to do this. .",

People with visual impairments navigate through a website with a screen reader, and if teasers and links are repeatedly inserted into relevant content, this can severely impair the user experience. Since users with screen readers cannot simply ignore irrelevant content or ignore it later. It is better to include such sections at the end of a page, so that users with screen readers can also ignore them. . . Multiple ways . A content-relevant page should be accessible via several ways within a page architecture. For example, a page can be accessible via a teaser in addition to the navigation. Ideally, there should be several content hubs within a page architecture which only serve to guide the user to his destination. These can be seen as an extension of the navigation and therefore do not disturb users with screen readers. This can help people with cognitive and visual impairments to find content faster. . Pages that only serve to redirect the user to other pages should not contain relevant content. Since they do not have to be visited to navigate the site.

If a website or app is designed and developed with the mindset “Accessible for all”, the experience is improved not only for people with disabilities. UX and Accessibility Design do not know any strict boundaries, a well thought-out UI design and barrier-free programming improves usability across all target groups. . . Accessible design does not have to be boring . A prejudice that can be heard again and again is that accessible design is boring and restricts creativity. I am always surprised about this attitude, is UX-Design really just “fancy digital product design”? For me it is rather the identification of problems and solving them. This does not mean that the solution cannot be aesthetically pleasing. But there is more to a well-balanced digital product than just making it beautiful. There is a strategy behind it for the architecture, for the content, for the code and a for the design. Besides, the principles of accessible design should be kept in mind by many more designers, so some questionable decisions would not be made in the first place. . .",
