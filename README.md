## üëã Welcome to the Accessibility Designer Guide! v1.0

If you are interested in barrier-free design and you need design guidelines to support you during the process, then you have come to the right place.

## About
As a UX designer I am daily confronted with the challenge of combining usability and accessibility. Finding the right balance is a big challenge. In the year 2020, I believe it is not acceptable for user groups to be excluded from digital solutions. That's why I wanted to focus more on the topic of accessibility.
